# üìö Course Notes: Machine Learning Specialization (Stanford University)
This repository serves as a collection of personal notes, summaries, and practical exercises related to the Machine Learning Specialization course from Stanford University on Coursera. The objective of this repository is to reinforce understanding, create a personal reference document, and share the learning journey.

## üéì About the Course
Machine Learning Specialization is a comprehensive course taught by Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera and a professor at Stanford University. This specialization provides a solid foundation in the core principles of Machine Learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and best practices in Machine Learning.

Foundation: Built upon fundamental Mathematical and Statistical concepts.

Main Programming Language: Python (and sometimes Octave/MATLAB in older versions of the course).

Key Modules:

Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms

Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning


## üìù Notes Content
Each note file (typically .md or Jupyter Notebook .ipynb) may include:

Theoretical Summaries: Key concepts, mathematical formulas.

Algorithms: Explanations of how algorithms work.

Code Examples: Illustrative code snippets (primarily in Python).

Exercises: Solutions or notes for practical exercises.

## üí° How to Use
You can navigate through the directories to find notes for specific sections of the course. The notes are written in Markdown for easy readability and reference.

## ü§ù Contributions
These notes are primarily for personal documentation. However, if you find any errors or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to create a Pull Request or submit an Issue. All contributions are welcome!
