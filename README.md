##‚ñ∫ Introduction
This repository contains my personal notes, code implementations, and summaries from the Machine Learning Specialization offered by Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. This specialization provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, from supervised learning to deep learning, reinforcement learning, and best practices.

The goal of this repository is to solidify my own understanding of the concepts and to serve as a reference for future projects.

##üìö Courses Covered
The specialization is divided into three comprehensive courses:

###üìà Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
This course covers the foundational concepts of supervised learning. We build models for regression (predicting continuous values) and classification (predicting discrete categories).

Key Topics:

Linear Regression: Model, cost function, and gradient descent.

Logistic Regression: Classification models, decision boundaries.

Overfitting & Regularization: Techniques like L1/L2 regularization to improve model generalization.

Practical Advice: How to apply and evaluate learning algorithms.

###üöÄ Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
This course delves into more complex and powerful algorithms, with a focus on neural networks and decision trees.

Key Topics:

Neural Networks: Architecture, forward propagation, and backpropagation.

Building Neural Networks with TensorFlow: A practical, hands-on approach.

Activation Functions: Understanding the roles of Sigmoid, Tanh, and ReLU.

Decision Trees & Ensemble Methods: Using multiple models together (Random Forests, XGBoost).

Advice for Applying ML: Best practices for model development, including setting up train/dev/test sets and debugging.

###üßê Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, & Reinforcement Learning
This course explores algorithms that learn from unlabeled data, build recommendation systems, and train agents to make decisions in an environment.

####Key Topics:

    Unsupervised Learning:

    Clustering: Grouping similar data points with K-Means.

    Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual data points for applications like fraud detection.

####Recommender Systems:

    Collaborative Filtering: Building systems like those used by Netflix and Amazon.

    Content-Based Filtering: Recommending items based on their features.

####Reinforcement Learning:

    Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): Formalizing the RL problem.

Q-Learning: Training an agent to maximize rewards.
