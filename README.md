📚 Course Notes: Machine Learning Specialization (Stanford University)This repository serves as a collection of personal notes, summaries, and practical exercises related to the Machine Learning Specialization course from Stanford University on Coursera. The objective of this repository is to reinforce understanding, create a personal reference document, and share the learning journey.🎓 About the CourseMachine Learning Specialization is a comprehensive course taught by Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera and a professor at Stanford University. This specialization provides a solid foundation in the core principles of Machine Learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and best practices in Machine Learning.Foundation: Built upon fundamental Mathematical and Statistical concepts.Main Programming Language: Python (and sometimes Octave/MATLAB in older versions of the course).Key Modules:Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and ClassificationCourse 2: Advanced Learning AlgorithmsCourse 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning📂 Repository StructureThis repository is organized according to the course structure, with each directory corresponding to a Course module and containing notes arranged by week or topic..
